👨🏻‍💻 I'm a first year currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Merced.

📚 I’m currently studying Machine Learning on the side and I am also doing research around Deep Learning.   

✅ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in learning in the world of Machine Learning and Academica. 

# Relevant Experiences

## 🔬 Research 
### LLM-based personalized grading to enable independent and open-ended summative assessments
Our team and I are currently trying to create a LLM-based personalized autograder to enable grading on independent and open-ended summative assessments. Esentially, we are trying to bridge the gap between Open Source LLM and Educational Technology, thus improving the learning and teaching experience between studnet and teachers.  

We are currently going through the final stages of fine-tuning the model and we will be submitting our paper under SIGCSE 2025, Technical Symposium.

This is the large open-source [LLM Auto-Grader](https://github.com/pyEdTools). You can contribute to this page by creating a pull request on GitHub. 

## 🙋🏻‍♂️ Leadership 
### UCM ACM AI Sig-Lead 
------
Orchestrated a series of AI-focused technical workshops as the AI-SIG lead to elevate the club members' expertise in Machine Learning and Deep Learning related topics. 

Topics Covered (2023 - 2024)
1. Predicting Housing Prices with Multi-Feature Linear Regression Model
1. Building an Artificial Neural network from scratch using only Python and Numpy 
1. Building a RAG application from scratch using Python, LangChain, and the OpenAI API 

## 💻 Community Contributions 

To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a Medium channel where I publish articles on my insightful experiences with Machine Learning and Undergraduate Research.
